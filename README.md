	<h1>Machine Learning Challenge: Spaceship Titanic</h1>
<p>I developed this notebook using Python and its libraries as a part of a Kaggle challenge. The objective is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with a spacetime anomaly. The data is available <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic">here</a> (also in this repository).</p>

<p>The dataset covers information of almost 13,000 passengers on board.</p>

<h2>Libraries</h2>

<p>The project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pandas</li>
	<li>Matplotlib</li>
	<li>Seaborn</li>
	<li>Numpy</li>
	<li>os and urllib.request are optional </li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To use the project, you can download the dataset from the link provided above and save it to your local machine â€“ you can also use the function I created to get the data from this repository. Then, open the <code>Energy Analysis.ipynb</code> Jupyter notebook file and run the cells sequentially. </p>

<p>The notebook includes cells to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Retrieve and load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame</li>
	<li>Clean and preprocess the data</li>
	<li>Group and filter the DataFrame to analyze different proposals</li>
	<li>Visualize the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn</li>
</ul>

<p>The notebook produces various plots and visualizations that provide insights into the energy production and consumption trends in different countries.</p>
<p>You can also modify the notebook and customize the analysis according to your requirements. If you have any issues or questions, please feel free to contact the project contributors.</p>
