<h1>Machine Learning Challenge: Spaceship Titanic</h1>
<p>I developed this notebook using Python and its libraries as a part of a Kaggle challenge. The objective is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during a collision with a spacetime anomaly. The data is available <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic">here</a> (also in this repository).</p>

<p>The dataset covers information from almost 13,000 passengers on board.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>First, I loaded the dataset which was already divided into train (8693 rows, 14 columns) and test (4277 rows, 13 columns). Both sets display informations about all the passengers in the spaceship, such as Id, Home Planet, Name, Cabin etc.</p>
<p>After a basic exploration on the train set, I did the EDA on all features, to visualize and extract insights.</p>


<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>The notebook includes cells to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Retrieve and load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame</li>
	<li>Clean and preprocess the data</li>
	<li>Group and filter the DataFrame to analyze different proposals</li>
	<li>Visualize the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn</li>
</ul>
